Q1.We are building a music streaming service. We have provided two lists, representing songs in a user’s library and the amount of times each song has been played.
Using a list comprehension, create a dictionary called plays that goes through zip(songs, playcounts) and creates a song:playcount pair for each song in songs and each playcount in playcounts.

Q2.Print plays.

Q3.After printing plays, add a new entry to it. The entry should be for the song "Purple Haze" and the playcount is 1.

Q4.This user has caught Aretha Franklin fever and listened to “Respect” 5 more times. Update the value for "Respect" to be 94 in the plays dictionary.

Q5.Create a dictionary called library that has two key: value pairs:
key "The Best Songs" with a value of plays, the dictionary you created
key "Sunday Feelings" with a value of an empty dictionary

Q6.Print library.
CODE-

songs = ["Like a Rolling Stone", "Satisfaction", "Imagine", "What's Going On", "Respect", "Good Vibrations"]
playcounts = [78, 29, 44, 21, 89, 5]

plays = {key:value for key ,value in zip(songs,playcounts)}
print(plays)
plays["Purple Haze"]=1
print(plays)
plays["Respect"]=94
print(plays)
library={"The Best Songs": {'Like a Rolling Stone': 78, 'Satisfaction': 29, 'Imagine': 44, "What's Going On": 21, 'Respect': 94, 'Good Vibrations': 5, 'Purple Haze': 1}, "Sunday Feelings": {} }
