Q1.Use a try block to try to print the caffeine level of "matcha". If there is a KeyError, print "Unknown Caffeine Level".
Q2.Above the try block, add "matcha" to the dictionary with a value of 30.
code-
caffeine_level = {"espresso": 64, "chai": 40, "decaf": 0, "drip": 120}
print(caffeine_level)
check="matcha"

try:
  print(caffeine_level[check])
except KeyError:
  print("Unknown Caffeine Level")

caffeine_level["matcha"]=30
try:
  print(caffeine_level[check])
except KeyError:
  print("Unknown Caffeine Level")

print(caffeine_level)

Q3.Use .get() to get the value of "teraCoder"‘s user ID, with 100000 as a default value if the user doesn’t exist. Store it in a variable called tc_id. Print tc_id to the console.
Q4.Use .get() to get the value of "superStackSmash"‘s user ID, with 100000 as a default value if the user doesn’t exist. Store it in a variable called stack_id. Print stack_id to the console.
code-
user_ids = {"teraCoder": 100019, "pythonGuy": 182921, "samTheJavaMaam": 123112, "lyleLoop": 102931, "keysmithKeith": 129384}

tc_id = user_ids.get("teraCoder", 100000)
stack_id = user_ids.get("superStackSmash", 100000)

print(tc_id)
print(stack_id)

Q5.You are designing the video game Big Rock Adventure. We have provided a dictionary of items that are in the player’s inventory which add points to their health meter. In one line, add the corresponding value of the key "stamina grains" to the health_points variable and remove the item "stamina grains" from the dictionary. If the key does not exist, add 0 to health_points.

Q6.In one line, add the value of "power stew" to health_points and remove the item from the dictionary. If the key does not exist, add 0 to health_points.

Q7.In one line, add the value of "mystic bread" to health_points and remove the item from the dictionary. If the key does not exist, add 0 to health_points.

Q8.Print available_items and health_points.
code-
available_items = {"health potion": 10, "cake of the cure": 5, "green elixir": 20, "strength sandwich": 25, "stamina grains": 15, "power stew": 30}
health_points = 20
health_points += available_items.pop("stamina grains", 0)
health_points += available_items.pop("power stew", 0)
health_points += available_items.pop("mystic bread", 0)

print(available_items)
print(health_points)
